Here's a quick look at the flow. 
This integration starts with a SOAP request, fetches data from the Northwind OData service, transforms it, and finally sends the result via email using a Mail adapter. Also included an exception subprocess to handle errors cleanly.

 ğŸ”¹ SOAP Sender: Accepts incoming requests.
 ğŸ”¹ Content Modifier: Prepares request payload.
 ğŸ”¹ Request Reply: Calls Northwind OData service.
 ğŸ”¹ Message Mapping: Transforms the OData response.
 ğŸ”¹ Groovy Script: Applies custom logic before output.
 ğŸ”¹ Mail Adapter (Receiver): Sends the final message via email.
 ğŸ”¹ Exception Subprocess: Handles errors and sends alternate flow if needed.
